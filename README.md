# WazzaP's Boss Generals Mod
The official repository of WazzaP's Boss Generals mod for C&amp;C Generals Zero Hour

## About this mod
This mod's purpose is to add in scrapped Boss Generals to Zero Hour. It aims to do it as vanilla friendly as possible and make it enjoyable and feel new and better. Also, it reworked General Leang (China's Boss) to be better. Instead of the ultimate Boss that didn't even have the best of the best, now she has the best of China.

Now, you might be asking yourself, why did I create a mod of my own if there's already a bunch of mods adding in the scrapped Boss Generals. Well, the answer to that question is really simple.

I didn't like how they were doing the Bosses. I felt that there was more to be done, and overall just more space to make it better. There were missed opportunities of adding in custom units that the Bosses honestly deserved, because they need something apart from having the best of the best to make them special.

Examples of these units are primarily the Super Units, Supersonic MiG for China, Supersonic Raptor for the USA and a Heavy Marauder for the GLA.
Then there's units like the Advanced Battle Drone for all USA vehicles and not really a custom unit, but something the GLA Boss needed, a Toxin Carpet Bomb.

## Where to report bugs
Do **NOT** report bugs in the [Issues Page](<https://github.com/ItsWazzaP/wazzaps-boss-generals/issues>), that is for me to do.

All the bugs should be reported in the mod's [Discord Server](<https://discord.gg/NPhSASmQBT>), and from there it is up to me to create an issue on GitHub and document it well from all the reports of the specified issue. This is done in this way to keep everything neatly organized, and for ease of access and communication on Discord.
