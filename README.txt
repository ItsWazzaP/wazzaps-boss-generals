Hello!
Thanks for downloading my mod! <3

I've made a previous mod called the China Boss General, which was an OP general that I made awhile ago.
You can still find and download that mod if you want to.
Link: https://www.gamereplays.org/community/index.php?showtopic=1068957

In this mod you'll find 3 new custom generals. The USA, GLA and China bosses.
These generals are for each faction containing modified units, structures and upgrades.
In the "350_BossGenerals_v1.8.big" file is the mod itself containing all the generals, hotkeys, custom names etc.
In the .bik files are the portraits for the Generals Challenge.

If there are any issues with the mod that I haven't found/fixed, leave a comment on the post.

**WARNING**

If you install this mod, you won't be able to play online with other players who don't have the mod.
Custom hotkeys like the Leikeze hotkeys WILL NOT WORK! IT'LL RESULT IN A CRASH! Make sure to remove any hotkeys before launching the mod!

***HOW TO INSTALL THE MOD***
1. Open your Zero Hour installation directory (Click on the shortcut, Open file location).
2. Drop the "350_BossGenerals_v1.8.big" file in the directory.
3. In the ZH directory open the following: Data, English, Movies
4. In Data\English\Movies drop in the 4 .bik files that came with the download
5. Open the game and enjoy ;)

***HOW TO INSTALL CONTROLBAR PRO FOR THE MOD***
1. Drop the 339_ControlBarProZH_BossGenerals.big into the file directory
2. Open the game and enjoy ;)
(Also compatible with ControlBarHD as the ControlBarHD only changes the textures, not the layout itself)

***HOW TO UNINSTALL THE MOD***
1. Remove the 350_BossGenerals_v1.8.big file (and the 339_ControlBarProZH_BossGenerals.big if you have ControlbarPro)
2. Remove the Comp_BossGLA_000, Comp_BossGLA_inv_000, Comp_BossUSA_000, Comp_BossUSA_inv_000
Not all of this has to be uninstalled. The game will work perfectly fine just by removing 350_BossGenerals_v1.8_b2.big
